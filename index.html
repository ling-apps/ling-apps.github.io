				I'm skilled in <b>javascript</b> and I've previously worked with <b>Angular</b>, <b>Ember</b> and other <b>MVC frameworks</b>.
				I know <b>HTML5</b> and <b>CSS3</b>.

			<p>I do write <b>tests</b> :)</p>
			<p>I like also to keep myself at the edge of the front-end technologies. Those days, I play with <b>Angular 2</b>, web components, and angular material design libraries.
			<br/>I'm also interested in new tools to improve the user feedback like <b>AB testing</b>.

			<p>
				I'm fluent in <b>english</b> and <b>french</b>, could work in spanish with a bit of training, and I'm learning swedish.
