				"I'm good at understanding the big picture and I can help to build the good solution with the right tools. I like to work in a "user first" mindset."
			</p>
			<p class="skills">
				I'm skilled in javascript and I've previously worked with Angular, Ember and other MVC frameworks.
				I know HTML5 and CSS3.

				I do write tests :)

				I like also to keep myself at the edge of the front-end technologies. Those days, I play with Angular 2, web components,and angular material design libraries but I'm also interested in React and Flux.

				I'm fluent in english and french, could work in spanish with a bit of training, and I'm learning swedish.

				Some of my projects are available on <a>github/blandine</a>
				And you can know more about me on <a>linkedin</a>.
